#### Kyles: 
I built the front and back end using React, Apollo Server, MongoDB, GraphQL, PokeAPI, RawgAPI, CSS, Tailwind, BCrypt, JSONWebTokens. Gabriel Andrews helped create the authentication and GraphQl, but due to issues with GitHub, could not merge. His commits are saved in GitHub. Lexie Holder helped style some pages with Tailwind, but due to issues with GitHub, could not merge. Her commits are saved in GitHub.
#### Gabriel:
For my portion of the project, I did a lot of work on GraphQL. I worked through module 21 and used its examples to create our project’s code. Also, I worked on styling the project with the others and giving any amount of help that I could.
